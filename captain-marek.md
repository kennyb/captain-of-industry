hi captain marek, last stream someone asked if you guys wanted to implement some kind of logic for the game. you said yes (eventually) and asked for suggestions. initially my idea for it looked something like a spreadsheet. over the last week I've been thinking about it a bit more (cause just a spreadsheet doesn't make actions), so here's my suggestion (this idea can potentially get some serious "feature creep" so be warned):

imagine a panel that can potentially replace the stats bar on the right (important that it stays visible when I click on an entity): from the top of the panel working my way down, there is a heading, followed by an expandable set of columns cells (the wider I expand it, the more cells I get). in each cell I can put text or a formula. a cell can reference another cell (=A3/2) or it can reference an entity and one of its properties (=$1234567890$.Capacity). if I want to reference a machine/cell in my formula, I click on the cell I want to put the value in, then I can click on another cell to get its reference (eg. A3) or I can click on a machine and it'll put in the entity id there (eg $1234567890$), and then have a dropdown/option list of properties that I can reference (capacity - total capacity of this storage, quantity - stored quantity, product_id - stored product id, product_type - stored product type (LOOSE,UNIT,FLUID), etc).
once I've added a few headings and corresponding worksheets, I should be able to see at a glance basic values of my factory (an option to display these values as little graphs like the stats would be cool, but not necessary). these cells and entity references will then be used in the next section (or tab): ACTIONS.
when I click on the [+] button, I'll type in a title ("CITY POOP chlorene") -- which becomes the heading for these actions. there are only two colums in each of these (perhaps with a third enabled checkbox): condition and action. the first one will be the check and perhaps a comment ($1234567890$.Percent < 10 // chlorene storage less then 10%) and then in the other column, the action ($12341234$.Enabled = true // turn on the electrolyzer). -- I'll obviously want to turn the machine back off when the storage is full, so I'll add another row: ($1234567890$.Percent > 90 // chlorene storage greater then 90%) and ($12341234$.Enabled = false // turn off the electrolyzer)
there will probably also need to be a bunch of globals as well: $POPS.Total, $POPS.Available, $POWER.Supply, $POWER.Demand, etc.
and that's it :) I don't recommend making an excel clone, so prolly cell formatting, time series graphs for the cells, cell/entity names (well maybe) aren't necessary; I just want a really simple array of observables where I can put in a custom formula and make actions when conditions are met. anyway, additions to this system could be a cool project for an able-minded programmer in the future though. the whole point of the cells is to generalize/summarise how I look at the values in my factory and allow me to have them available to make actions on.

### 2024-07-13 07:04 - loading screen and customize difficulty

the other thing I noticed in your previous stream is that someone was asking about a thing that was difficult -- and you showed them that they can just customize the difficulty to turn that off. I thought that was a great suggestion, but it's not really very obvious to the player. that could be improved by perhaps a tip on the loading screen (or some interactive way to adjust the difficulty during the loading screen (cause afaik, it doesn't require a reload)).
another thing that I was thinking about for users, is to make the tips a little bit more relevant as well: so, if right before the loading screen, a bunch of vechicles were out of fuel, "Tip #11 - make sure you have enough crude oil, or else your vehicles will run out of fuel and your logistics network grinds to a halt" -- or if I ran out of food right before loading "Tip #12 - make sure you have enough food, or else your pops will starve" -- stuff like that to help the player more easily identify improvements they could make. well, let's say that 4 loads in a row, they run out of food, displaying that tip or another more helpful one ("Tip #13 - farms require a constant source of water to grow properly and not dry out") -- that tip may not actually be that helpful, so maybe show the difficulty setting to adjust from dry to normal or wet, and the farms yield one -- so that they can adjust it right there while loading and try it out (they can always reload)
finally, I'd like to mention that the UI for the customize difficulty is a bit strange with all of the dropdowns. I like that red is hard, grey is normal, and green is easy -- but I want to see at a glance what kind of difficulty I'm looking at without needing to click on the dropdown. so, I might suggest instead a slider bar where one side is green and the other is red -- and as I drag it, the text below/above it changes to the value:
```
|o----|
  Wet
|----o|
  Dry
```
it just feels easier and less resistance to change or look at the other values if I can drag a slider (with color feedback) vs 2 clicks per option using a dropdown
