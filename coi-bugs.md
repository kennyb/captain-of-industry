# coi bugs

- ore sorting plant ports don't update when changing their port (only updats when I deselect & reselect)
- (not really a bug) metal casters shouldn't have a truck import option
- flat/loose lifters don't show "[Height: 2]" tooltip in second phase of construction
- (probably not a bug) when selecting to build groundwater pump, it shows all of the layers, not just the water sources.
- dragging pause tool pauses the construction of connectors (kinda unintuitive, because they can't be unity built)
- when pressing "collect" on a completed tutorial (or when a new one gets added), it expands all the other tutorials (instead of keeping them minimised)
	- even on the hardest difficulty (dry, -40%), I find that one rain collector is sufficient to keep up with my copper needs in the earlygame; 2 is too many.
	- 
- if I pause the vehicle depot right after a truck builds (before the animation completes), it will just sit on the driveway even though there are jobs
- (!!!) make a pipe and connect annother to it. build one of the pipes with unity. delete the other pipe and upon removal of the connector, the pipe will have lost both the parts, the unity and the under construction status (it goes back to being white and not constructed)
