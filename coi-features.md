# coi features

### little things
- ability to drag trucks around in vehicle depot queue
- ability to drag ports around in the materials sorter (the dropdown doesn't provide much info where the port is, and doesn't update until I deselect & reselect)
- click on unbuilt loose/flat lift and have up/down arrows in the popup window allowing me to raise/lower it
- automatically connect two belt slices, just the same as if I connect a pipe/belt where the slices meet, and then remove the belt/pipe, so that they join again.
- pin a window, so it stays open
- ability to zoom out farther
- in new game on mouseover of the resource, put thr name and the quantity (ex. "Sand 110K")
- in save/load game dialog, next to "+NEW SAVE" also add "Rename" -- which allows me to rename the save
	- workaround is to click "Show in folder" button and rename it in windows explorer
- notification when digger is complete in vehicle depot
- press a button (f?) to override the "incompatible port"

### bigger things
- inside of the island folder, save a replay file, which keeps track of every action the player makes.
	- intention is to watch (or make a video of) my island developing over time
	- maybe add hitkeys and mouse clicks? (probably not. though, it could be good for content creators)


### nice things to have
- diagonal bridges.
	- bridges in corner sitations are impassible
- ability to widen/narrow a bridge.
	- sometimes I want a bridge over a whole bunch of belts and want them to be able do drive diagonally over it, as if I buried the pipe
- 6-sided pipe connectors (!!!)
- on mouseover the resource layer bars, it puts a floating number, so I don't have to count.
- ability to put the pipes the color that I want them to be (the new pipe colors look way worse, IMO)


### stuff that would make the game feel better
- trees with a range of wood yield (each tree's amount determined probably by the game seed and the entity id) small/palm trees: 3-7, medium trees: 7-15, large trees: 10-20 (enabled with a difficulty setting?)
