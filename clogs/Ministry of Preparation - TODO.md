- set priorities for crackers and water works
- 3 exc for copper, 4 for iron, 3 limestone
- delete steam power next to refinery
- upgrade sw pipes (and put balancer)
- upgrade slag belts
- set priorities for city poop

- add tree chopper (3) & planter (3)
- import coal with gas kiln and contract

- upgrade slabs belt
- add heavy oil cracking + hydrogen
- move rubber upstairs (save a bunch of trips)


- set other forestry towers to use top fuel station
- priority in sw strippers and boilers
- turn off wood chips export (real wood killer)
- set bottom pier diggers to use bottom ore sorter
- flip pipe next to farms
- pause top water pipe down to farms
- tree planters confused with hill
- put fertilizer to 110%
- delete old pier digger tower
- fill in front pier for contract space (not next to shipyard)

----

- empty rubber and sulfur buckets (from old rubber)

- diesel generators piority
- turn on basic distillers
- set 3 exc to coal (rest to rock)
- tree planting designations on the hill
- priority out on gas boiler water pipe
- set dumping on front pier
- rubber maker belt
- turn off rock dumping next to shipyard (only space for trading dock)
- set fuel depot to forestry towers
- set two trucks to empty tree saplings bucket (assigned only)

- turn off power generator (save steam) and flow all naptha over to get cracked
- upgrade sw pipe between units
- set notification for FG tank (and upgrade it)

----

set pumps and dumps to no trucks
set mixer and sulfur bucket to higher priority (and import)

trees for woodcutter
chlorene notification
import iron bucket
upgrade coal belts
fix steel smelter
move one copper to iron temporarily
delete all surface designations
copper belt
upgrade boiler/fg pipe

----

release truck assigned to box
fix fg balancer priorities
rubber sulfur belt
turn off slag creation and truck import (also put alarm on bucket)
set woodchipper to have same priority as bucket

set new forestry towers to be built
upgrade swater pipe and output pipes
(later) add steam overflow
move iron/copper mining towers closer to the sorters
remove unused balancers for naptha and swater and crude
remove fg boiler balancer
add exhaust scrubbing balancer
scrub exhaust for top smelters and science boiler
stray fertilizer pipe

### convert to hydrogen 8
- pause one of the diesel generators
- fix upper copper exhaust pipe
- set farms to 3x saplings @110%, rest @100%
- turn on 2 coal desals
- upper mixer to produce slag
- setup compost dump next to bakery
- remove top front planter to use new expanded area
- electronics for cp2
- set large areas for forestry towers
- crack to naptha instead of diesel
- fix tree planter over near c-office
- build pickup instead of planter
- LE1&2 + fert + glass indicators
- POOP COMPOST + SAPLINGS
- stop deconst (use unity)

### convert to hydrogen 9
- upgrade FG pipe all the way through
- convert h-oil to H
	- build 2nd naptha cracker
	- upgrade h pipe next to boiler
	- set priority on reformers
- convert FG boiler to hydrogen + add reformers
- build trading dock
- research house 3
- add another desal (to replace the coal ones)
- convert cargo ship to use hydrogen
	use diesel as H tank
- add another bakery
- turn on plenty of food for more unity
- upgrade:
	- steel box
	- mp1 box
- move saplings box over where there's a bunch of dirt

### more slag mountain
- prioritise limestone
- add a few more forestry designations on side of copper mountain
- consolidate all forestrey into one tower
- top limestone flat at 37
- turn off ununsed cw pump
- set compost to empty into slag mountain (set to empty)
- LPS balancer priority
- slow down concrete/cement use by turning lowering cp1 production to 1-2
- turn off an iron smelter
- set upstairs mining towers off of dumping rock
- set storage boxs to not import (keep them from returning them from the shipyard)
farm water priority prevents smelters from running all the time (prioritise LPS desals)

### try coal contract
- research large storage
- reroute goat pipe
- export compost
- upgrade 2 houses to house 3
- diesel overflow into cracking unit

### try coal contract 8
- upgrade slag belts
- move el1 over and put mp1 there instead
- saplings boxes names (MOAR SAPLINGS!!!, NOT ENOUGH SAPLINGS, TOO MANY SAPLINGS)

### dig ramp
- move excs over so they dig UP the ramp (instead of theirselves into a hole)
- move gw pump over
- exc: 5 iron, 3 copper
- move sci asm over and add another air separator

### goat belting
- add 3rd steel smelter
- add sws & turn off NH3 production
- upgrade naptha pipes

### 4th refinery module
- expand limestone designations
+ fix sws pipe
+ add another saplings box up top
+ set fert to 130% until NH3 goes down
+ scrubber pipes
+ add a coal boiler next to scrubbers
+ set limestone bucket to import only half the way
+ turn off truck import/export on water tanks

+ move 2 excs up to iron
+ set mining tower exports to ore sorters
+ change ramp diggers to go up to +23 and start working on the middle shelf (the idea here is to flatten the entire left side to +23, putting all forestry there and belting stuff up to to production)
+ upgrade output pipe to 200 (unfortunately 21x3 > 60)
? merge boiler and scrubber pipes

move ore sorters

### redo refinery spaghetti
redo pipe spaghetti in front of oil import
	fert2 pipe to run in front of sw strippers
	nh3 out pipe over the mess
	n2 pipe over the mess
	remove lift in front of limestone
	move slope so cl2 pipe can go under fert1 pipe
	set sws water out to connect to water pipe where fert2 pipe was
move diesel to naptha cracking and redo pipe spaghetti in front of pumps
	make bus space 3 wide + 1 pumps + 1 crackers
	put sw pipe at 1 and hps at 2, naptha at 0
add 3rd chem plant and upgrade one of the mixers (boost one of the chem plants )

### move steam
+ upgrade cwp pipes
setup 4 h-boilers and 4 coal boilers over near coal contract (scrubbed) for the final form of that refinery

### scrub bottom exhaust


### FUTURE
quartz import
	limestone import
add sw tank


### upgrade smelters
run water pipe from over by copper and delete pipe that goes over the belts
move slag bucket over and put limestone bucket next to it
run limestone belt on top of copper belt

upgrade rubber box
sw for slag contract
	process dirt into bricks to reduce load on cement
	transition into using only bricks (until dirt runs out) and send all slag out
