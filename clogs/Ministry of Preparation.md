### 2024-06-03 09:53 - the polution problem

I decided to start working on this one again (I took a few month break), but I want to see how I do by adding in the extra difficulty of writing about what I'm doing and *some* (cause it's impossible to express all) of my thoughts. it's been quite a bit, so I'm just gonna kinda go from memory. actually, I have a TODO list I left for myself... I remember I was trying to make the pivot into fertilizer, at the same time as making the water pipes next to the farms better and also moving the bakery.

- add another limestone digger (or make bigger limestone storage and have the exc work part-time)
- rearrange slag booster belt (don't remember what was wrong about it)
- priority diesel generators (to ensure power doesn't fail)
- build 2 chem plants and preferrably 2-3 mixers (one for slag and other for fertilizer)
- set rubber to use sufur
- diesel pipe on top in front - fertilizer in back
- turn off import/export for sulfur/slabs bucket
- run diesel and fertilizer/water pipe in front of the shipyard.

in addition to those things, I remember that I'm thinking my best route is to try and get a few extra tech labs (up to 6), and just try to get to wastewater treatment and exhaust scrubbing. air pollution is the next biggest threat. I have enough crude for 200-300y. it seems like food is also gonna be OK as well, because with fertilizer I'll just have so much more food that I can afford the extra workers.
I also think that I want to research glass smelting and get a quartz contract before I upgrade to big trucks. I'll probably keep the setup that I have now for a while because I can easily expand it with only 2x adv diesel -- though that'll likely get expanded because I have to convert all my power over to diesel, because all of that coal has to be for smelting until I get CO2 -> graphite (at which time I'll still likely run diesel until I can get to hydrogen).
	there's this thing that I sorta have against using uranium for some reason. the base that I see in the future has lots of pumps and dumps to turn LPS into clean water -- then combine that with hydrogen to get power -- and more clean water. also, it seems that I won't be able to afford even the slighest amount of radiation because of how much it (and other types of pollution) affects health. it's got to be hydrogen all of the way.

### 2024-06-03 13:31 - start over lol
- upgrade sw water pipe + put balancer
- run diesel and fertilizer/water pipe in front of the shipyard.
- fixup farm pipes
- build 2 chem plants and preferrably 2-3 mixers (one for slag and other for fertilizer)
- move bakery

### 2024-06-04 10:51 - start over one more time (0159-02-17)

so, playing coi while stoned is a most difficult task. I realise I need to just start over. so I'm starting over from 0159-02-17 -- we'll see how it goes. gonna try and remember some of the todo items. also, btw, it's a LOT easier to type qwerty, as well... that took me so long to type yesterday...

### 2024-06-05 11:18 - this time for reals (0160-06-02)

- ~~coal belt over to desals (save trucks driving distance, and I can use the space in front of desals for something else)~~
- ~~turn on gw pumps to full and use that water preferentially to the desal (save coal)~~
- ~~delete two of the diesel generators and put in a bucket for light oil (so I know when to turn on and off the hp turbines to expend the excess steam)~~
- run water pipes down the middle so that they aren't going on top of copper mountain
- ~~put in sulfur bucket and mixer to make acid up top~~
- build the other two science labs and just coast for a while, while research is getting done

this is kinda a pivotal moment, because on one side, I want to boost science and coast for a while, but I don't think that I can, actually. I'm probably going to have to come back and do the techs that I missed a little bit later (it only costs a little steel and some wood), because I really need: wastewater treatment, exhaust scrubbing, and electrolysis (to split the excess amonia). we'll see. I'll try both probably

### 2024-06-06 15:42 - I think I got this (0166-04-04)

I really feel good about my progress yesterday (it really helps not being stoned). I managed to get the 6th farm built, and get fertilizer into them. I also got to stable trucks for a bit, but it went away pretty quickly. though it says "extremely busy", stuff is getting delivered pretty fast even with P14 constructions. it seems that the "extremely busy" is counting all of the dump jobs of rock in the shipyard and ore sorters -- which is quite a few: I had 5.7k rock 10ya, and now only 2.1k.
- research belts mk2 (so that I can have more than 2.5 AS3 creating CP1 at a time, reducing my slag dumping, and also more slabs for paving)
- ~~add limestone, iron, and coal diggers~~
- get T3 going, and research:
	- wastewater treatment (water pollution is -9) 
	- exhaust filtration (air pollution is -13)
	- housing 3 (need more pops for more stuff; food isn't an issue anymore)
- run water pipes down the middle so that they aren't going on top of copper mountain, and build an ore sorter for copper and iron (so trucks don't have to drive so far)
- ~~move some of the sw storages over to heavy oil~~
- ~~move the bakery (to put in 2 more housing modules)~~

#### 2024-06-06 23:19 - got some of it done

I didn't make it to T3 at all, and it seems that I'll probably just complete all of the research before moving to T3, because I need to kill a bunch of pirates. I still haven't found the next oil rig yet, and I think I may cheat to find it by remembering where it is and then reloading the game. so far I've found a sulfur mine and a coal mine... lol. that will only help me out a little bit though, because when I closed the game just now (0180-06-23), I had enough crude, and 850 pops, so everything is pretty good, just I was making stupid mistakes like forgetting to put the limestone digger back on after the bucket emptied... so, time to sleep :)

### 2024-06-14 23:21 - going t3 (0177-07-12)

the other night I played a testing run to see if I could get to t3, to kinda see what the problems would be. turns out it was really easy actually. not only did I get that done, I also was able to put the two new ore sorters in and get the gw pipes moved off of copper as well. after that, I fiddled around with surfaces and decals and stuff while everything went into a death-spiral. anyway, tonight I plan to accomplish the same thing, but with even less effort. I also experimented with the new t3 labs, and they don't research the t2 researches very much faster at all (I'd say about 10-20% faster) and require twice as much lab equipment to do it, so I'll probably just coast for a bit and get all the researches I know I'll need in the next little bit. the next major hurdle seems to be population, which is dramatically increased pollution -- which is a case for perhaps going t3 early and just eating the extra parts cost for research -- though I dunno yet and haven't decided if that's what I want to do (my gut says that I should go as t3 asap though). after that, the next hurdle is actually going to be feeding everyone. to speed the game up when I was playing (more unity to build things), I turned on plenty of food -- but it became clear that 120% fertilizer is prolly too high. I'm gonna reduce it to 100% so I'm in line with my diesel usage. I also filled enough for another two farms, but I can't afford the water until thermal desal is done and I have exhaust filtration producing LPS.
I also decided that I won't be upgrading to yellow trucks until I get glass making and hydrogen going cause I found that with 95 blue trucks, I'm actually stable and dumping tons of rock into the ocean as well. speaking of which, I'm going to need to expand the dock area considerably because I'm going to need to run all of the exhaust down the hill to the shore where many exhaust filtrations and desals are setup to produce a lot of water for the farms and town. after that, I'm really going to be needing to reduce coal usage by a lot, so stage 3 refinery and gas kiln I think are necessary after that. I may have to do chicken farm for the extra health bonus (and I have tons of wheat and soon tons of water). we'll see.

### 2024-06-16 21:06 - sand and fuel gas (0194-08-06)

I successfully made it to t3 pretty effortlessly, but I'm kinda short on pops (they slowly die off every flu season), so I'm constantly short on workers. to get around this, I'm kinda cheating: I pause and unpause the oil import ship every time it arrives to save 22 workers (it just needs the workers to leave and can apparently drive without crew) -- and I have to pause a lab to build more lab equipment from time to time as well -- however, I believe that as soon as I have wastewater treatment (I'm 1.5 researches to go) and get exhaust scrubbing done, then health will go up significantly. so, tonight's tasks are to get both of those done, then put in stage 3 refinery modules and use FG for steam instead of light oil. I don't know if I'll be able to make it all the way tonight, but I want to have hydrogen stuff all researched so once I get a stable source of sand (and glass making built), I want to convert directly to hydrogen vehicles (it's way more efficient per crude imported and also significantly less vehicle pollution, allowing me to upgrade to yellow trucks and excavators finally). during that process I want to build a pretty large VP2 setup on the coast and use it to import quartz (for glass), crude (for hydrogen), and iron (for VP2), which then only needs a little bit of copper for the electronics bits -- I now have the ability to fully upgrade the fleet and do mass excavation to take down the whole island I'm on. that's pretty far ahead though... anyway, tonight:
- ~city poop (more water, less coal)~
- exhaust scrubbing (for now, I'll just vent the steam)
- use cement for coal import and (optional) see if I can't burn FG instead of coal to make cement (I'm really trying to reduce coal usage).

### 2024-06-18 23:36 - exhaust scrubbing & refining (0206-04-21)

the poop problem wasn't that big of a deal -- and it was only a slight reduction in coal usage. however, I'm faced with a challenge of where to put in the scrubbers. my instinct says to put them in on the dock and pipe all of the exhaust down the hill, but obviously 180 exhaust is more to pipe down the mountain than 72 seawater is to go up -- however that gives me easy access to acid and water up top (there's only one gw pump so only about 150 water up there max atm which is enough for concrete, acid and (soon) bricks -- for right now) -- and that system can easily be supplemented with water running up the hill. trucking some sulfur up there isn't really a problem (way less than the amount of coal I'm sending up the hill), and also the dock is going to (hopefully soon) have a bunch of smelters on it doing massive vp2 imports. as I expand that, I'm going to move the entire cp production down to the dock so I don't have to keep sending coal up the hill. so, better to go down with the resources than up -- however, that isn't going to happen anytime soon -- so, as soon as the ramp is built, I have to expand the dock in the front, cause I'm good enough on food for now -- and with the decrease in pollution I can actually skip the +8 health bonus and feed them only bread for a bit (until I get chicken farms). tonight's tasks will be:
- run more pipes down the side of the mountain, slide the bakery over to fit in big bridges
- get exhaust pipes running all the way down to the dock (and vent it there until scrubbers are built)
- put in a bunch of exhaust scrubbers on the dock (start with the boilers and the diesel generators)
- add refinery stage 3 and tank the naptha until cracking research is done (fg outputs CO2 which is less pollution that light oil)
- desal the scrubber's steam into water

### 2024-06-22 03:34 - coal and exhaust scrubbing (0216-08-04)

turns out the refinery upgrades were the thing that took my time up. I also [built a spreadsheet](/spreadsheets/refineries.ods) to calculate the requirements for my needs. the way that I'm going to do it is (in addition to the scrubbing, I'm going to convert the majority of diesel into naptha >> fuel gas >> hydrogen), and use desal units and hydrogen boilers to provide water and power to the town and stuff (each setup uses 148 pops, generates 7MW, ~10NH3 for fertilizer, and ~96 water) -- meaning each module can run farms for prolly another 2k pops (haven't done the maths yet). I'm going big (like my goal is 50k+ pops) and I'm just gonna run on massive amounts of oil for gold contracts (probably -- or at least until that giant gold mountain is gone), and use that massive oil import to just go full hydrogen setup. I think that's realstically the only way I'll be able to do something with such a difficult pollution. I may try going nuclear in the future, but for now (while I'm doing so much smelting), I want to have a power source that's zero pollution (or nearly zero until I get CO2 to graphite research).
in addition to creating the spreadsheet, I managed to triple my electronics output -- and where the existing electronic smelters are, I now have space to expand concrete if I need to (to keep up with the slag output, I may want to). I also managed to dramatically increase cp2 production which is good cause I need a lot of those.
tonight's tasks are going to be:
- cement for coal contract
- actually getting exhaust scrubbing going.

### 2024-06-22 22:10 - coal and exhaust scrubbing (0216-08-04)

do over. I was prett tired last night, so I didn't really make much progress at all. the coal issue is starting to loom large, so I need to get the cement for coal contract started -- and of course the exhaust scrubbing will make my water problems disappear. after that's done, I really need to find the quartz for vp2 import contract and start working that one out (I haven't even found a quartz mine yet). not sure how I'm gonna work that one out yet, cause until I can get more pops, I may need to fill in the coal mine temporarily for more town space and get coal from contracts. the other thing I'm strongly considering is converting my farms to do only wheat and for the second category, go with chickens (cause I'll have plenty of water and lots of extra wheat (which is the best conversion to animal feed)).

#### 2024-06-23 03:50 - not so easy as I thought

the serious issue of not having enough pops is really killing me. the only way that I can think of doing it, is to build the last two farms, and move everything over quite a few spaces. that'll give me room to build 8 more housing modules -- which I'll probably need a few more farms to do that (or suffer low health and feed them only bread until I can add chickens). I didn't try the chicken strat, but if I'm moving all of those things over to make way for houses, there's space next to the mountain to build chickens farms -- which need a lot of water, but I think that'll come through just fine once I get exhaust scrubbing (3x72 water output).

### 2024-06-23 17:55 - move farms over by one and do heavy oil cracking (0220-04-02)

I decided that my best bet is to delete the two farms next to the town (giving space for 8 more housing modules (1040 more pops)). in order to feed them I'm just gonna feed them bread for now (until I have enough water for chickens). then, the whole space where the farms used to be will become an only-truck-zone (OTZ), which will allow me to run a bunch of exhaust pipes at hight 2 all along the town, and leave only in front of the shipyard able to pass cause I'll still need to get sand from the beach over there (and also clean up the trash/slag). then, meanwhilst trying to setup the cement for coal contract (which will need a lot of pops (120+ at my current rate of spending coal)), I've got to get heavy oil cracking and the water system converted from FG over to hydrogen (more efficient and less pollution).

### 2024-06-24 01:01 - dover no wood (0208-10-11)

I really need to increase my forestry by a lot, it turns out. I ran into a situation where I'm completely without trees in 0233, which means I need a whole lot of them planted ~20y before (hence why I'm going back to 0208). the plan to convert them over to only bread was pretty successful (apart from a few dieoffs during flu season) and really gave me a lot of extra capacity on the farms -- so I'll do that. I'm also going to make the transition to another copper build much sooner as well, as that also seems to be quite successful. also the coal import contract really seemed to work pretty well. here's the list of things to do (prolly not tonight, but generally):
- go up to 5 tree planters and expand forestry
- convert pops over to only bread (and the rest saplings)
- move copper smelting and electronics over to the side there
- move rubber upstairs
- try to get coal import contract a bit sooner
- once again try and get scrubbing to work
- expand out farms to the right with rock dumping instead of working on the front pier

### 2024-06-27 03:11 - try again to get wood (0214-08-22)

the other night I really ran into a problem with my wood. even though the game was in a pretty good state, and I'm sure I could use that branch to actually win, I was literally waiting for wood to grow, and it would take some 10-15y before I was back to full production again; so, I abandoned the branch and went back to 0208 to try again. I bought more planters and got my farms producing more saplings, so I feel a little bit better about making it this time. I'm 20y away from the time I ran out of wood last time (0234), and I have a few more trees planted this time, and my 5th tree planter is just now coming out. however, because I've had to race to get to higher tree production, I've been using a lot more diesel than before, which is kinda a problem. I have ~300 cp2 from canceling the captain's office upgrade, and I'm likely going to spend it on power generators (either that or farms and another house module), and when desal research gets done (prolly 4-7mo from now), I'll add on the desal to get enough water for the farms. I already redirected the gw reserve to go to the farms for the extra water requirements (something I didn't need to do on the abandoned branch), so we'll see how that goes (the reserve is already empty, so it's not likely to help much). I really think I need to build the naptha cracking and the generators so oil doesn't backup, then just wait for desal before I do the farms. though I could build another 2 basic distillers (+36x2) to add those two extra farms (-30x2) and that would ensure I have enough food for the extra workers and also more saplings. one thing I also noticed (right before I ended last time, so I could go back again and redo it another time) is that I'd been exporting and burning wood chips in the boiler -- which is an enormous waste of wood. I'm gonna try both strats, and if neither of them work, I'll have to go back and turn that off sooner (quick maths: 4 farms are producing 36 saplings every 1.5 years (8 trees planted per month -- rather, each farm produces ~40 wood per month), yet I'm only consuming ~64 per year (160 wood is less than 64 so I *should* be fine, hopefully)). we'll see.

### 2024-06-30 01:36 - try again (02-08-0218)

I got really stoned a few days ago (friday?) and the consequence is that I can't remember *anything* at all of what I was doing. I'm gonna reread the above clogs to see what I was on about, but it's sorta a new experience (I took a lot of weed, and didn't eat for quite a long time (20h+) during the trip so it was pretty intense). I'm gonna give it my best shot -- but...
one of the things that I noticed while I was stoned is that I'm farely dishonest writing in these clogs because I don't play the game at all like I make it sound. I play the game *conceptually*, so all of these ideas are symbolised (ie, translated into english) a system of concepts that give me reminders while I'm playing the game in the form of a feeling to do certain things, so that my play resonates with the concept that I have in my mind of how the game should go. that's why when I'm really tired or on a lot of drugs, my play style really suffers cause I can't feel the conceptual/feeling reminders. I do often times create the concept symbolically (as in I want to up tree planting so I don't run out of wood), but it's often when I create thec concept symbolically, then I tend to overcompensate and go beyond what I'm trying to accomplish.
case in point, in the last playthrough I bought a lot more tree planters (6), so I'm gonna have plenty of wood (perhaps a small slump around ~0132, but it should be pretty fine after that), but scaling the farms to be able to keep up with the extra saplings required more basic distillers running, so I ran out of coal a lot faster. I also spent more diesel much faster too because I didn't get the water and power setup going, because each turbine I run removes 4MW of load off of the diesel generators AND produces 72 water, so I was neither lacking on either diesel or water in the aborted playthrough (aborted 7) -- yet I was in this one. it seems that my instinct to just play it slow and keep things going well was the right idea -- so I'm gonna slow down a bit and just build things as I get the parts, staying in a mostly stable state.

### 2024-07-01 01:24 - went really well (0218-08-18)

after a number of tight spots (like gettting naptha cracked), the game went really well from there on out. I played out the game for quite a while after that (till ~0223) and felt really good about the trajetory the game has. it's pretty obvious that I need to start cracking heavy oil and get hydrogen production up (but I wasn't gonna do that yesterday) -- so an oil rearrangement is in order for today, along with a coal contract (because I nearly reached the bottom of the coal mine yesterday) and exhaust scrubbing for even more water (I'm just gonna vent excess lps when water backs up). after I've got lots of water, I want to experiment with putting chicken farms in, and see how viable that is (+8 health is a HUGE BONUS -- though, just cleaning up the exhaust will also be huge)
- crack heavy oil and FG into hydrogen
- convert cargo ship over to hydrogen
- exhaust scrubbing
- cement for coal contract

#### 2024-07-01 01:43 - going back further actually (0214-12-20)

I noticed a huge booboo where around 0215-04-03, I loaded the crew on the ship, and I vaguely remember taking out some pirates, but in the process of reloading, I must have forgot to send the ship out again (this is a perfect case where [pragtical-coi](/pragtical-coi.md) would come in handy). so with an extra 35 workers, all the stuff I did yesterday would be much easier (for example I don't need to pause the cargo ship every time he leaves to save 22 workers, when I have 35 sitting in the ship doing nothing (lol)). so I'm just gonna go way back and redo it. it'll be *a lot* easier this time... lol
turns out the last time I had that going was "naptha cracking 4" (0215-02-05), which is quite a ways back. the previous save to that one is "naptha cracking 3" (0214-12-20) -- a very long time ago -- so I'm actually contemplating going back further -- like say back to when I was doing city poop -- and move that forward a bit, because it'd be really nice to have a 2-3 tile gap between the poop facility and the town (to run the exhaust pipes through). it also allows me the opportunity to run rubber creation up to the top much earlier too. not sure yet what I'll do. gonna try this one for a bit.

### 2024-07-01 02:51 - city poop once again

looking at it, I feel pretty good about going all the way back to "city poop 10" (0200-06-12) and starting from there. I rearranged the pipes so that 9 pipes/belts can make it through the front of the town now, which means that I'm gonna try and get scrubbing up much faster this time. here's the general overview
- after poop isn't being dumped into the sea anymore, convert the pops over to bread and water diet (no more veg means faster planting of saplings and more forestry)
- move the bakery earlier
- get desal research next and scrub exhaust for farm water
- move rubber up top and expand copper faster
