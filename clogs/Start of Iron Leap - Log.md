### 2024-10-22 16:14 - try it on neptune

I decided to give it a go on neptune cause captain is *wayyyyyy toooooo easy*. going well so far. I've [made one mistake](<Start of Iron Leap - Save Comments.md#mining-and-dumping>) but I'm too lazy to go back and redo for it. I lost a month or two of food, but that's about it. anyway, I feel it's going to be good to have two maps that I'm working on. I also changed up the format a bit, adding something that I wanted to make, which is save comments (things I could improve, etc) in addition to the TODO. we'll see how it goes.
