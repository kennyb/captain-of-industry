# Start of Iron Leap (SOIL) - Captain's Log

### 2024-10-22 16:14 - try it on neptune

I decided to give it a go on neptune cause captain is *wayyyyyy toooooo easy*. going well so far. I've [made one mistake](<Start of Iron Leap - Save Comments.md#mining-and-dumping>) but I'm too lazy to go back and redo for it. I lost a month or two of food, but that's about it. anyway, I feel it's going to be good to have two maps that I'm working on. I also changed up the format a bit, adding something that I wanted to make, which is save comments (things I could improve, etc) in addition to the TODO. we'll see how it goes.

### 2024-10-22 18:21 - neptune is way harder

I [seriously under-estimated neptune difficulty last night](<Pirate Bay - Log.md#2024-10-22-0021---try-this-one>) and have made my first fail. I totally forgot how difficult it is to feed such amounts of people (121 pops). I'm gonna keep going because I know it's possible. I think it's also not that difficult to add a 3rd farm -- so I'll try that. it's good to know that it's not going to be as easy as I thought it would be. also, I may have to go back and [fix my fail](<Start of Iron Leap - Save Comments.md#mining-and-dumping>). we'll see. gonna keep trying.
