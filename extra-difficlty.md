# extra-difficlty

all buildings have cp upkeep to them (kinda like maintenance but for structural integrity)
belts cost maintenance
different tree sizes
waste decomposes and caves in
certain materials are unsuitable to build on (like sand) and therefore the building/machine needs extra concrete slabs or cement to be built on a foundation
